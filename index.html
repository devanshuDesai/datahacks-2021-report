		We are living in an environment that is tremendously impacted by economics. Our lifestyles, decisions we make, and the future that we are hoping to create are involved in the current economy. However, we would never know when the next economic crisis would hit us but what we can do is to forecast the future
		economy by utilizing the current and the past data that we have to prepare ourselves for the crisis so that we could avert the crisis.

		Stock markets are useful for us to learn about the economic changes. Through the history of the great recession in 2008 to the COVID-19 recession, we observed that stock markets performance helps us to study the current economy, and so that we are able to adjust to the financial crisis. Therefore, in this particular
		the study, we will be looking at the S&P 500 for which measures the stock performance of top 500 enterprises in the United States to forecast our upcoming economy performance.</p>

        <div class="title">Overview of Data</div>
        <p>The data comprises 67 financial indicators of the health of the United States economy spanning from the year 2000 to 2020.
		The indicators measure everything from infectious disease risk to foreign exchange state and unemployment rate. We categorize the 67 features into primarily three categories:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>External Macro Relationships:</b> This group of time series data all share similar characteristics as they are updated every business day.
			They require minimal data preprocessing techniques. This group includes: multiple commodity futures, major foreign exchange pairs, different treasury related data in order to include the daily macro effects around the world.</li>
			<li><b>Internal Interactive Effects:</b> This group of data represents the internal interactive effects within the U.S. equity market. This includes indices to measure the “mood” of the market participants.
			ETFs/market trackers that represent different industries are included with a goal to include the effect of different business cycles.</li>
			<li><b>Low-Frequency Fundamental Data:</b> The previous two groups allow the models to have an idea of what is happening on a daily basis due to the high frequency of the data.
			However, in order to measure the financial market, it is also important to look at the lower frequency economic and fundamental data.
			This group includes lower frequency data that are released on a monthly/quarterly basis, hence data preprocessing techniques such as forward fill or interpolation will be needed. The economic indices are chosen in order to cover the different areas such as growth, inflation, employment, income and expenditure, and debt.</li>
