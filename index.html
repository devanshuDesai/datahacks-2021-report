		We are living in an environment that is tremendously impacted by economics. Our lifestyles, decisions we make, and the future that we are hoping to 
			create are involved in the current economy. However, we would never know when the next economic crisis would hit us but what we can do is 
			to forecast the future economy by utilizing the current and the past data that we have to prepare ourselves for the crisis so that we could avert the crisis. 
			
			Stock markets are useful for us to learn about the economic changes. Through the history of the great recession in 2008 to the COVID-19 recession, 
			we observed that stock markets performance helps us to study the current economy, and so that we are able to adjust to the financial crisis. Therefore, 
			in this particular study, we will be looking at the S&P 500 which measures the stock performance of top 500 enterprises in the United States to forecast our 
			upcoming economy performance.</p>
